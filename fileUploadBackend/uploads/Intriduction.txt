I belong to a middle-class family. My strength is I am a self-motivated, hard-working, and Disciplined person, My short-term goal is to get a job in a reputed company and my long term goal is to achieve a good position where I can build my career and help the organization too. After 10th I have done diploma in E&TC After that I took the admission for E&TC degree course but my preference was always Comp or IT sector but some region I did not get the admission to the comp IT branch, so I have various computer courses completed with my regular study such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Core Java, Adv java, etc. I did my graduation in Bachler of Engineering from Pune University in 2019.
